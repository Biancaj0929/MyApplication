<a name="introduction"></a>INTRODUCTION

---------------------------


The Bucket List app is an Android Application that allows users to create, organize, and manage a list of goals, both immediate and long-term. To assist with motivating users, reminders can be configured to keep users on-track, and individual achievements will be given when a certain number of goals are met to give a sense of personal accomplishment.



<a name="requirements"></a>REQUIREMENTS

---------------------------


To utilize the Bucket List app, you will need an Android-capable phone or tablet running on Android version 4.3 (Jellybean) or higher, and the ability to side-load or otherwise transfer an unsigned *.apk to an Android device.


It is helpful to install a file manager, such as Astro or ES File Explorer, onto your device to locate the correct file for proper installation.



<a name="installation"></a>INSTALLATION

-------------------------


Installation of this app will consist of 'sideloading' onto an Android device. To sideload:

<ol>

<li>From Android device, go to Settings--> Security--> Unknown Sources. This will allow apps outside of the Google Play store to be downloaded.</li>

<li>Download the BucketList.apk file onto your device.</li>

<li>Locate the BucketList.apk file on your device. If needed, use search function on a file manager app, such as Astro or ES File Explorer. </li>

<li>Once located, select the file. A pop-up window will appear asking if you want to complete the action using App Details (Astro) or Package Installer. 

<li>Select App Details and tap Just Once. A new screen will appear showing the app info. </li>

<li>Tap Install at the bottom of the screen. A new screen appears asking if you would like to install the app. </li>

<li>Tap Install again. A new screen appears and informs you the app was installed.</li>

<li>Tap Open at the bottom of the screen to open the app.</li>

</ol>



<a name="configuration"></a>CONFIGURATION

-----------------------------

This version of the app does not have modifiable settings, and therefore, no configuration is required to adjust user preferences.



<a name="troubleshooting"></a>TROUBLESHOOTING

---------------------------------


If you receive an error when attempting to download the app:


 * Ensure that on your Android device, the "Unknown Sources" box is checked under Settings--> Security.


 * Ensure you select the App Details installer rather than the Package Installer in steps 4 and 5 of installation instructions.
